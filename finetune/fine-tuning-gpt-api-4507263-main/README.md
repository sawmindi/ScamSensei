Fine-tuning your own GPT model allows you to submit examples of the types of responses the AI system should provide based on user input. It allows you to more tightly control the output from the AI system, including setting voice and tone, controlling output format, following patterns, and adding preset data references.

Join LinkedIn Learning senior staff instructor and AI whisperer Morten Rand-Hendriksen in this short, skills-based course, as he shows you how to fine-tune GPT-3.5 Turbo by uploading your own data and creating a unique custom model. Test out your new skills as you progress through the course in the hands-on practice exercises integrated with GitHub Codespaces.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
